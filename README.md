# Project Description
Running a business can be a time consuming task and you should be able to devote as much time as possible to building its success. As a manager of an orgization or company, it is essential to be able to keep track of all employee information to ensure the success of the company. With that being said, the Employee Directory Application will make it easier for a manager to store and track all of their employees in one place. This application will allow the manager to search, view, and filter their employees by their name, phone number, email, and birthday. Using the RandomUser API, the application loads a table of 30 employees. The manager can sort and search or filter the table by their name, phone number, email, or birthday.
